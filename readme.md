## üìú Overview

Leika is a smaller quadruped robot for the Spot-Micro community.
Built on an ESP32 and powered by FreeRTOS, she can handle multiple tasks seamlessly‚Äîlike video and data streaming, solving kinematic and gait planning, controlling I/O, and much more.
By focusing on practicality and simplicity in both hardware and software, it offer an accessible platform for learning, experimentation, and modest real-world applications.

## üìê Robot specifications

### üåä Robot control flow

The robots is implemented using a sense, plan, act control flow.

![control flow](images/flowchart.png)

## ü¶æ Kinematics

To enable complex movements, it's beneficial to be able to describe the robot state using a world reference frame, instead of using raw joint angles.

The robot's body pose in the world reference frame is represented as

$$T_{body}=\left[x_b,y_b,z_b,\phi, \theta,\psi\right]$$

Where

- $x_b, y_b, z_b$ are cartesian coordinates of the robot's body center.
- $\phi, \theta,\psi$ are the roll, pitch and yaw angles, describing the body orientation.

The feet positions in the world reference frame are:

$$P_{feet}=\\{(x_{f_i},y_{f_i},z_{f_i})|i=1,2,3,4\\}$$

where $x_{f_i}, y_{f_i}, z_{f_i}$ are cartesian coordinates for each foot $i$.

Solving the inverse kinematics yields target angles for the actuators.

<!-- Write about the calculation, rotation matrix and trig -->

<!-- L1, L2, L3, L4, L, W -->

<!-- $$
R_{body} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\psi\cos\theta & \cos\psi\sin\theta\sin\phi - \sin\psi\cos\phi & \cos\psi\sin\theta\cos\phi + \sin\psi\sin\phi \\
\sin\psi\cos\theta & \sin\psi\sin\theta\sin\phi + \cos\psi\cos\phi & \sin\psi\sin\theta\cos\phi - \cos\psi\sin\phi \\
-\sin\theta & \cos\theta\sin\phi & \cos\theta\cos\phi
\end{bmatrix}
$$ -->

### üéÆ Controller

The controller is a Svelte app, which get embedded in the firmware of the robot.
Which means that new releases and OTA updates include the latest controller.

The controller includes full control over robot settings like network and calibration, and a visualization.

<!--## üß† Kinematics

The kinematic for the robot is from this [kinematics paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320307716_Inverse_Kinematic_Analysis_Of_A_Quadruped_Robot). A C++ and TypeScript library was written to enable onboard calculation and fast development iteration using the robot mirroring.

## üèÅ Motion state controller

The motion controller is a finite state machine with states allowing for static and dynamic posing, an 8-phase crawl, Bezier-based trot gait, and choreographed animation.

### Controller Input Mapping

The controller input is interpreted differently between the modes.

| Controller Input | Mapped to Gait Step | Range   |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| Left x joystick  | Step x              | -1 to 1 |
| Left y joystick  | Step z              | -1 to 1 |
| Right x joystick | Step angle          | -1 to 1 |
| Right y joystick | Body pitch angle    | -1 to 1 |
| Height slider    | Body height         | 0 to 1  |
| Speed slider     | Step velocity       | 0 to 1  |
| S1 slider        | Step height         | 0 to 1  |
| Stop button      | E stop command      | 0 or 1  |

<!-- ### Static and dynamic posing -->

### Trot gait (12 point bezier curve)

The trot gait implements a phase time $t\in[0,1]$, but instead of using contact phases we define a swing/stance ratio of phase time offset for each leg.

The stance controller implements a sin curve to control the depth of steps.

The swing controller implements a bezier curve using 12 control points centered around the robot leg.

Rotation is calculated using the same curve.

### 8-phase crawl gait

The 8-phase crawl gait works by lifting one leg at a time while shifting its body weight away from the leg.

As the name implies, the gait consist of 8 discrete phases, which represents which feet should be contact the ground or be in swing.

At each time step the phase time $t\in [0,1]$ is updated. When $t\geq 1$ the phase index is updated and phase time is reset.
