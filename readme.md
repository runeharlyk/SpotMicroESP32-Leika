The 3D prints is assembled with some additional component:

* 84x M2x8 screws + M2 nuts
* 92x M3x8 screws + M3 nuts
* 64x M3x20 screws + M3 nuts
* 12x 625ZZ ball bearings

### Software

The software make use of a range of different libraries to enhance the functionality.
Up to date list can be seen in platformio.ini file.
The libraries includes:

* Esp32SvelteKit
* PsychicHttp
* ArduinoJson

#### Structure

The software utilizes a couple of FreeRTos task
| Task | Description | Priority | Core
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| Idle0 task | Burns cpu time to track cpu usage for core 0 | 0 | 0
| Idle1 task | Burns cpu time to track cpu usage for core 1 | 0 | 1
| Analytics service task | Periodically sends analytics data | 1 | 0
| Spot service task | Handle synchronous services | 2 | 0

#### Feature flags

To dis-/enable the major feature I use defines. Define them in either featureflags.h or in platformio.ini's build_flags.

| TF_POWER_BUTTON | Whether or not to use power button | 1
| TF_USS | Whether or not to use ultra sonic sensors | 1

### ðŸ“²Web application

The web application is a simple Svelte app, which main focus is to calibrate and control the robot.
<!-- Write about the emulation, stream, controls and link to the space issues -->
It is made to be included and hosted by the robot.
Therefore there is placed a lot of thought behind the functionality and dependencies.

#### Development dependencies

For the development dependencies I choose the following

| Dependencies | Description
| --- | ---
| Svelte | SvelteKit is an application framework built on top of Svelte, enhancing it with features like routing, server-side rendering, and static site generation. It streamlines the development process by integrating server-side capabilities with Svelte's client-side benefits. Furthermore it make the development process fast and enjoyable.
| Vite | Vite is a frontend tool that is used for building fast and optimized web applications. Is serves code local during development and bundles assets for production
| Typescript | TypeScript's integration of static typing enhances code reliability and maintainability.
| Tailwind CSS | Tailwind CSS accelerates web development with its utility-first approach, ensuring rapid styling and consistent design.
| Vite single file plugin | This plugin inline all JS and CSS in the *index.html* file, which is necessary as SPIFFS max file length is 32 bytes.
| Vite compression plugin | This plugin compresses the *index.html* file making the final footprint a lot smaller.

#### Libraries

For the app functionality I choose the following:

| Dependencies | Description
| --- | ---
| [Three](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three) | Easy to use, lightweight, cross-browser, general purpose 3D library.
| [Urdf-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urdf-loader) | Utilities for loading URDF files into THREE.js and a Web Component that loads and renders the model.
| [Xacro-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xacro-parser) | Javascript parser and loader for processing the ROS Xacro file format.
| [NippleJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nipplejs) | A vanilla virtual joystick for touch capable interfaces.
| [Uzip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uzip) | Simple, tiny and fast ZIP library.
| [ChartJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js) | Simple and flexible charting library.

### Space issues

As the ESP32 has very limited storage for program and filesystem, it quickly became a challenge to fit the web app and program in the 4mb of flash.
Just the robot models files were â‰ˆ8mb. So the first step was to minify the files.

My first idea was just to zip the files and then unpack and store them on the browser side.
This reduced the models footprint to â‰ˆ2mb. Great start, but still way to big to fit in flash.

Next step was to make the actual model files smaller, by decimating them.
Exterior model files where kept in higher resolution while the interior could be reduced more.
This was the biggest change and made the final footprint of the models â‰ˆ550kb.
A total reduction of â‰ˆ94% for the model files.

But the problem was not solved yet. The final *index.html* file was â‰ˆ650kb.
The obvious solution was again to compress it, this time by using gzip.
This made the file size for the *index.html* 184kb. With all the optimization the data folder was only 756 KB. Awesome!

The last step to fitting the web app on the ESP was to expand SPIFFS part of filesystem image.
At this step I had to cut some corners to make it fit, mainly by disabling over-the-air update. But a last the filesystem image build and uploaded to the ESP!

## Kinematics
