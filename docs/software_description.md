# Software description

The software make use of a range of different libraries to enhance the functionality.
Up to date list can be seen in platformio.ini file.
The libraries includes:

- Esp32SvelteKit
- PsychicHttp
- ArduinoJson
- Adafruit SSD1306
- Adafruit GFX Library
- Adafruit BusIO
- Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library
- Adafruit ADS1X15
- Adafruit HMC5883 Unified
- Adafruit Unified Sensor
- I2Cdevlib-MPU6050
- NewPing
- SPI

#### Structure

The software utilizes a couple of FreeRTos task
| Task | Description | Priority | Core
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| Idle0 task | Burns cpu time to track cpu usage for core 0 | 0 | 0
| Idle1 task | Burns cpu time to track cpu usage for core 1 | 0 | 1
| Spot service task | Handle synchronous services | 2 | 0
| Camera streaming tasks | Handle streaming to a single client | 1 | -1

#### Feature flags

To dis-/enable the major feature defines are used. Define them in either features.ini or in platformio.ini's build_flags.
| Feature | Description | Default
| --- | --- | ---
| FT_SLEEP | Whether or not include sleep management | 0
| FT_UPLOAD_FIRMWARE | Whether or not to use OAT | 0
| FT_DOWNLOAD_FIRMWARE | Whether or not to use github for firmware updates | 0

| FT_MAG | Whether or not to use magnetometer (HMC5883) | 1
| FT_BMP | Whether or not to use barometer (BMP085) | 1
| FT_SERVO | Whether or not to use servo (PCA9685) | 1

### ðŸ“² Controller

The controller is a SvelteKit app, which main focus is to calibrate and control the robot.

<!-- Write about the emulation, stream, controls and link to the space issues -->

It is made to be included and hosted by the robot.
Therefore there is placed a lot of thought behind the functionality and dependencies.

#### Development dependencies

For the development dependencies I choose the following
