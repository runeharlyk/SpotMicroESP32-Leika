There exist a number of great resources for the assembly of the spot micro. For this reason I refer to these, as the steps are the same for this version:

- [Michael Kubina SpotMicroESP32 assembly](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/tree/master/assembly)
- [Spot Micro AI assembly](https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assembly/)
