### Start the Development Server

Use the following commands to launch the development server with Vite, enabling instant updates:

```sh
cd app
pnpm run dev
```

Please note that this example uses the `pnpm` package manager. For any other package manager such as `npm` or `yarn`, please adjust the command accordingly to run the dev command.

[Download the pnpm package manager from pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/installation)
